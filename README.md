# DeepSeekVBA
DeepSeek VBA script

此页面旨在快速提供一个可在 Word 中实现的 Visual Basic 脚本，用于集成 DeepSeek 的 API。我创建这个页面是因为我跟随的视频示例中的脚本没有提供。请随意复制并使用它，或将其作为个人需求的示例。

This page is designed to quickly provide a Visual Basic script that can be implemented in Word for integrating OpenAI's ChatGPT API. This script is an extension to the DeepSeek script since I was not able to create an account for DeepSeek at the time. NOTE: The directory contains a wordkey; this one serves as a template so any user can have a point of reference. The number is actually random and will therefore (most likely) not work.
